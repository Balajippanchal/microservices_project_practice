    <h1>Hello, Welcome to the DevOps Session on Docker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
    <h2>Deploying the web application on a Docker container</h2>
    <h3>Deployment is successful!!!!!!!!!</h3>
    <h4>Success</h4>
    <p>Deployment by Rishabh !!!</p>

    <p>In this session, we explored the process of containerizing a web application using Docker. Docker provides an efficient way to package, distribute, and run applications within isolated containers.</p>

    <p>We covered various Docker commands, such as building Docker images, creating containers, managing container networks, and deploying applications. Understanding these concepts is crucial for modern DevOps practices.</p>

    <p>By leveraging Docker's capabilities, teams can achieve consistency in development, testing, and deployment environments, leading to improved efficiency and scalability in software development workflows.</p>

    <p>Thank you for joining this session! Feel free to explore more about Docker and its vast ecosystem for containerization and deployment.</p>
